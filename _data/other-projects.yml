  code: https://github.com/roshinisanikop/Mitigating_Bias_in_Facial_Recognition_using_Seldonian_Framework
  description: We aimed to address bias in facial recognition systems by utilizing the Seldonian framework to implement fairness-aware constraints. Our work involved conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of fairness-aware models (e.g., those enhanced with Seldonian constraints) and fairness-unaware models, such as ResNet50 and VGG16. The study highlighted significant improvements in both fairness metrics and overall model performance, showcasing the potential of integrating fairness considerations into state-of-the-art facial recognition systems.
